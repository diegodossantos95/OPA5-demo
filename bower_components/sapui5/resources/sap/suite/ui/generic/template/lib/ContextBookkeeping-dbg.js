			// More precisely, the entry contains the following properties:
			// - oContext: the context. Note that it is removed, when the entity is deleted.
			// - oContextInfo: information about the context. This object has the following attributes:
			//                 - bIsDraftSupported: Does the entity this context belongs to support draft at all			
			//                 - bIsDraft: is this context representing a draft (only possible when bIsDraftSupported is true)
			//                 - bIsCreate: Is this a create context
			// - oSiblingPromise: This property is only valid for non-create drafts. In this case it contains a Promise that resolves to the context of the
			//   active sibling. The property is filled when this Promise is requested the first time (via getDraftSiblingPromise).
			// - oEditingPromise: This property is only valid for top-level active contexts that support draft. In this case it is available, as soon as an editing
			//   session for this object has started. It is removed again, when the editing session ends.
			//   The promise resolves to EditingInfo when the editing really takes place. Thereby, EditingInfo has a property 'context' which contains the 
			//   context of the editing draft.
			//   The promise is rejected, when the editing session could not become active (e.g. because the object is currently locked by another user).
			// - oRemovalPromise: This property is only valid for top-level drafts. In this case it is available as soon as an cancellation (only for edit drafts) or activation session for this
			//   draft has started. If this session fails (e.g. because the activation is rejected) the Promise is rejected and oRemovalPromise is set to be faulty again.
			//   If the session succeeds the Promise resolves to an object with a property 'context' which contains the context of the active version.

			// are not stored in this registry (since they do not yet exist on the server).
